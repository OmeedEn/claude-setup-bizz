### Reddit Comment (When Someone Posts About Needing Help)

> I actually do this for businesses — I set up custom Claude AI agents that plug into your existing tools (Shopify, CRM, etc.) and handle [specific thing they mentioned]. Most clients save 15-20 hours/week. Happy to chat if you want to see how it works.

## Qualifying a Lead

Before spending time on a prospect, check:
- [ ] Do they have a clear pain point AI can solve?
- [ ] Do they use tools with APIs (Shopify, HubSpot, etc.)?
- [ ] Is their team small enough that automation makes a real difference?
- [ ] Can they afford $750+ for the setup?
- [ ] Are they the decision-maker?

If yes to 3+, they're a good lead. Book the discovery call.
